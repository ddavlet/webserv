Further steps:
    1. Check if method is allowed to this path
    2. Connect path + folder name (right now it is hard coded)
    3. Chunk files cleaning if socket closed and/or limit excided and/or other exceptions
    4. Take variables from configuration, rather than constant define
    5. Parse form data (if not file(s))
Known issues:
    1. Files dropped if directory does not exist
    2. Parsing depends on headers with no checks if header exists
    3. Form containing data, but not ONLY file(s) is parsed incorrect
