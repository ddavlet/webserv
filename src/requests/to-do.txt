Further steps:
1. Check if method is allowed to this path
2. Connect path + folder name (right now it is hard coded)
3. Chunk files cleaning if socket closed and/or limit excided and/or other exceptions


Known issues:
1. Files dropped if directory does not exist
2. Parsing depends on headers with no checks if header exists
